# FlashCardsBasic

A basic app for reviewing flashcards. The flashcards are presented in small groups, are randomized with weights, and can be saved for later studying.

The files that can be used as input are csv files organized as ABAB. The first AB is intended to be the front and back of the flashcard, and the second AB is intended to be addtional notes.
